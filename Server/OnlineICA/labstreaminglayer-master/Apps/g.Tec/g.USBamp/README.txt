== Installation ==

Before you can use this program you must have installed the drivers for your g.USBamp. If your device is not found and your amp is of version 2.0 (serial number of the form UA-XXXX.XX.XX), you might attempt to copy the file misc/gUSBamp-for-2.0.dll into this folder and rename it to gUSBamp.dll.

== Optional ==

The configuration settings can be saved to a .cfg file (see File / Save Configuration) and subsequently loaded from such a file (via File / Load Configuration). Importantly, the program can be started with a command-line argument of the form "gUSBamp.exe -c myconfig.cfg", which allows to load the config automatically at start-up. The recommended procedure to use the app in production experiments is to make a shortcut on the experimenter's desktop which points to a previously saved configuration customized to the study being recorded to minimize the chance of operator error.
